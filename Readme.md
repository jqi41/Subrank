# C++ source codes for the Unsupervised Submodular Rank Aggregation on Score-based Permutations. 

![img](https://github.com/uwjunqi/Subrank/blob/master/Figure.png)

- To compile the codes, please run the make. Then run the following command to show the performance of Fold1 in MQ2007:

$ `./main --compNDCG=true --nVoters=46 --topK=10 --USraKind=0 data/train.txt data/test.txt`

If you use the codes are associated with the paper as below:
